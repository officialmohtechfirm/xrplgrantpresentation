Github documentation on the plan to introduce CryptoPal


My plan is to use this grant to create a CryptoPal system which is similar to PayPal except it is global, decentralized, provides subscription charging features etc. Is basically like the crypto version of PayPal where the xrp ledger will utilize XRP's fast technology to swap tokens. Similar to a pancakeswap but with PayPal features on top of it as well. 

XRP's Ledger will utilize XRP to liquidate assets and then transform them into the intended asset or currency one wishes. Cashapp allows buying of stocks and crypto and transfer of money. I plan on doing the same with the help of Ripple or those providing the grant. I will build a team of developers to assist in this venture. Developers who build on the legder get residual from token burns\redistribution. The main idea is to be the Paypal and Uniswap of crypto with a plethora of financial features. 

I can go much more into technical details if needed reach out to my email to get my phone number if interested in learning more or asking questions.
